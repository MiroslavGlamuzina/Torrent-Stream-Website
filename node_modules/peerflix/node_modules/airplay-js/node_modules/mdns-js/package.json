It's not much left of that now though.\n\n__NEW LOCATION__\n\nThis project was moved into it's own organisation. Please update any git remotes you might have pointing here.\n\n    git remote set-url origin https://github.com/mdns-js/node-mdns-js.git\n\nInstall by\n\n    npm install mdns-js\n\nIf you are running node version < 4.1 you will have to use a version of this library that is below\nversion 0.5.0\n\nFuture\n------\nIt would be great to have a full implementation of mDSN + DNS-SD in pure JS but\nprogress will be slow unless someone is willing to pitch in with\npull requests, specifications for wanted functions etc.\nAlso, as you should avoid to have multiple mDNS stacks on a system this\nmight clash with stuff like avahi and bonjour.\n\n\nexample\n-------\n\n```javascript\nvar mdns = require('mdns-js');\n//if you have another mdns daemon running, like avahi or bonjour, uncomment following line\n//mdns.excludeInterface('0.0.0.0');\n\nvar browser = mdns.createBrowser();\n\nbrowser.on('ready', function () {\n    browser.discover(); \n});\n\nbrowser.on('update', function (data) {\n    console.log('data:', data);\n});\n```\n\nReporting issues\n----------------\nPlease report any issues at https://github.com/mdns-js/node-mdns-js/issues\n\nBut please check if there is a similar issue already reported and\n__make a note of which OS__ and OS version you are running.\nThere is some issues that turn up only on Windows 8.1 but not in \nWindows 7 for example. And there are differences between Mac and \nWindows so... __please__...\n\nAnother important thing to know if there is another mdns service\nrunning on the same machine. This would be for example Bonjour and Avahi.\n\n\nDebugging\n---------\nThis library is using the [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) \nmodule from TJ Holowaychuk and can be used like this.\n\n```bash\nDEBUG=mdns:* node examples/simple.js\n```\n\nThis will spit out LOTS of information that might be useful.\nIf you have some issues with something where you might want\nto communicate the contents of a packet (ie create an issue on github)\nyou could limit the debug information to just that.\n\n```bash\nDEBUG=mdns:browser:packet node examples/simple.js\n```\n\nContributing\n------------\nPull-request will be gladly accepted.\n\nIf possible any api should be as close match to the api of node-mdns but\nbe pragmatic. Look at issue #5.\n\nPlease run any existing tests with\n\n    npm test\n\nand preferably add more tests.\n\n\nBefore creating a pull-request please run \n\n    npm run lint \n\nThis will run jshint as well as jscs that will do some basic syntax\nand code style checks.\nFix any issues befor committing and creating a pull-request.\n\nLook at the .eslintrc file for the details.\n\n\nLicense\n=======\nApache 2.0. See LICENSE file.\n\n\n\nReferences\n==========\n\n* https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-app-samples/tree/master/samples/mdns-browser\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_configuration_networking#Service_discovery\n* RFC 6762 - mDNS - http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6762\n* RFC 6763 - DNS Based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) - http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6763\n* http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_DNSMessageHeaderandQuestionSectionFormat.htm\n\n\nContributors\n============\n\n* James Sigurðarson, @jamiees2\n* Stefan Sauer, @ensonic\n",
